# Urban Poet
### Introduction
Urban Poet is a music and lyric discovery app where the user can discuss songs and lyrics. The user can also upload there own music to the web app.

### Technology
This web app is hosted on heroku, using node.js for the server. The database used is Mongo, and communication between the database and server is handled by Mongoose.js. Express.js is used for routing and AJAX requests are employed by the front end for communication to the backed. The app uses MusixMatchs API for the lyrics, and the SoundCloud API for the song player. Jquery is used for DOM manipulation, and EJS is used for rendering the HTML. Bootstrap 4 and SASS are used for styling. The SASS is converted to CSS using Gulp, and the API tests were done using Mocha and Chai
